# SGT now with Angular v0.1

For the Angular version of the Student Grade Table you will be adding functionality using Angular. For this version we are looking to see that you
understand the introductory concepts of Angular, using basic directives and a basic controller to display student data in a table.



## Getting Started
> - Switch to **YOUR** v0.1 branch that has a completed version of the `index.html` file
    - `git checkout v0.1`
    - Verify you have a completed `index.html` file on your v0.1 branch
        - **YES:** Move to next step
        - **NO:** Find a branch that does have a completed `index.html` file
            - **NOTE:** If you do not have a completed `index.html` file reach out to an instructor
> - Create a feature branch
    - `git checkout -b ng-0.1`
> - Work on the scope defined <a href="https://github.com/Learning-Fuze/SGT/tree/angular_lf#scope">Below</a>
> - Add files to git
    - `git add .`
> - Commit files (Group files together)
    - `git commit -m "SGT Angular v0.1 - Your Name"`
    - **Replace "Your Name" with your first and last name**
> - Send to gitHub (Push)
    - `git push origin ng-0.1`

## Scope
>- AngularJS Functionality
    - In a `js` file create a controller to do the following
        - Create a variable (array) that will hold all of the student objects
        - Create an add method that will add a student object to the array and reset the input form
        - Create a method for removing a student from the array
        - **Bonus** (optional) Make the average grade display
    - In the `index.html` file
        - Add the necessary angular directives to make the SGT functional
    - **TIPS**
        - Make sure to reference the Angular material you have already received, everything you need is within the slides
        - The instructions are intentionally vague, not every step is listed above but try not to over think it. Keep it simple
        - If you get stuck for more than 30 min ask for help
        - Don't forget to add the <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/#angularjs" target="_blank">Angular CDN</a>
